# 🌠 NASA ASTEROIDS CLASSIFICATION

## Aim

The aim is to:
1. Find potential hazardous and non-hazardous asteroids.
2. Find features responsible for claiming an asteroid to be hazardous.

## ML Algorithm Used

Naive Bayes

Naive Bayes methods are a set of supervised learning algorithms based on applying Bayes’ theorem with the “naive” assumption of conditional independence between every pair of features given the value of the class variable.

GaussianNB implements the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm for classification.

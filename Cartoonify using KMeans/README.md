# Cartoonify_reality
Even the basics of image processing if done properly can be handy which otherwise would require a machine learning model.This project is one of such inspiration which **cartoonizes** images and videos using only core **opencv filters** and functions.It also uses K-means clustering algorithm to compress the image. This clustering gives it the basic cartoonish tinge it requires.

**Algorithm**- K_Means Clustering

**Filters**-Bialateral Filter, Contours, erode, Canny(edge detection)


### Prerequisites

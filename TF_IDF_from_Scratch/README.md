# TF-IDF from Scratch

TF-IDF is a statistical measure that evaluates how relevant a word is to a document in a collection of documents. This is done by multiplying two metrics: how many times a word appears in a document, and the inverse document frequency of the word across a set of documents.

The project tries to replicate an abstract version of the TFIDF vectorizer in abstract way, also calculating cosine score of the documents to make the results visual with an end to end program
